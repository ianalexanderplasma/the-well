                This Privacy Policy applies to this website, thewell.network, (“Site”) that is owned and operated by Ian Scott and Tim McHugh (referred to as “we”, “us” or “our”).
                <br><br>
                This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party websites that you may be able to access from our Site, which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from those described in this Privacy Policy, nor does it apply to any services that may be offered by our partners, where your personally identifiable information is collected by anyone other than us.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-xl my-6 leading-6 font-medium">1. Data We Collect</h2>
              <p class="my-2">
                We collect personal information from you for a variety of reasons. 'Personal information' is any information about a user which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify that user, or otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with that user. Information such as a username and password, an email address, a real name, an Internet protocol (IP) address, and a photograph are examples of 'personal information.'
                <br><br>
                Personal information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information that does not identify a user or cannot otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with that user (See Section 4 for further detail). We may use such aggregated, non-personally identifying information for research purposes and to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our Site.
                <br><br>
                We do not intentionally collect 'Sensitive Personal Information,' such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data (where processed to uniquely identify someone), and/or data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. If you choose to store any Sensitive Personal Information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.
                <br><br>
                We also do not knowingly collect information from, or direct any of our content specifically to, children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Site. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close their account. For further information, please see Section 11.
                <br><br>
                The table below further describes the different types of information we collect about you (personal and otherwise), why we use that information, and where we received that information.

You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request. In some circumstances if you still ask us to delete your information, you may no longer be able to access or use our Site.
